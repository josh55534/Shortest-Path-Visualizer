# Shortest Path Visualizer
This project is a project to understand and visualize various pathfinding algorithms as well as compare how they differ. The program allows users to set a start and finish nodes and place obstacles for the pathfinding algorithms to work around. After that, the program will animate the nodes so the user can see how the algorithms search for the finish node from the starting node. Then the program lists the number of nodes that the algorithm visited before giving the shortest path as well as the length of the path found by the algorithm in terms of number of nodes.

## Deployment
Node.js is required to run the program. Make sure you also have node packet manager (npm) installed on your machine. Both can be installed [here](https://nodejs.org/en). If the commands don't work in your terminal, you might have to add Node.js to your system's path variable. To deploy this project make sure you have the dependencies installed with:

```bash
  npm i
```

After that, the project can be initialized with:
```bash
  npm run dev
```

Then the project can be accessed via preferred web browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
